    # Username pattern to create username
    # You can use placeholders in the patterns, e.g. $[AccessToken.name] will be replaced with the
    # claim value of the `name` attribute in the access token
    # The claim values and other placeholder information is taken from:
    # - the access token that is provided in the Authorization header, in this case the placeholder
    #   has to be in the form $[AccessToken.<claim>]
    # - the user info that is retrieved from the IDP UserInfo endpoint, in this case the placeholder
    #   has to be in the form $[UserInfo.<claim>]
    # - the Signature Activation Data (SAD) token that is provided in the request body or
    #   Authorization header, in this case the placeholder has to be in the form $[Sad.<claim>]
    # - the Credential that is representing the credential of the user, currently only the id is available,
    #   in this case the placeholder has to be in the form $[Credential.id] and it will be replaced with the
    #   alias of the key pair that is used for signing
